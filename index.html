    <div class="body-copy"> Dan has 16 + Years with the Boeing Company and is currently a Supply Chain Analyst for MMO NW Support Bulk for Boeing Test and Evaluation supporting 777X and 737-7 Wire Kit Demand. My Supply Chain experience includes working for PCO Operations, Inventory Control as an MPRF in Interiors and working for 777 Tooling as a Schedule Compliance Specialist, tracking and reporting status on parts from Shop to Shop at the Everett Plant.

      I utilize my background in Software QA and as a Business Analyst towards learning new systems that help assist Supply Chain Support such as GOLDesp and the new EPARTS system that is gearing up for release.
      
      Previously I worked for Boeing Test and Evaluation in Seattle as a Business Process/QA Analyst and Product Owner. I assisted Manufacturing and Design Engineers with helping to Design and Test Software that would help track their Work Statement Packages for Flight Test Operations more efficiently. I also managed Onshore and Offshore teams to replace manual processes by assisting to develop and deploy the Flight Test and Design Engineering Software systems which helped save man hours and salary dollars for Boeing. Since inception (2012) the new system has saved Boeing approximately 2+ million dollars a year in salary and expenses.
      
      My long-term goal is to serve In Supply Chain at the Boeing Company. I have a Certificate in Supply Chain Management from the University of Southern California and a Certificate for Integrated Supply Chain Management from the University of Huntsville Alabama.
      
      I am the White Hat backup focal for our 2-31 Building. In my off time I am a musician and play Drums, Bass Guitar and Guitar.
